\# Matrix School Automation (Google Sheets + Apps Script)



\## 1) Overview

A production-grade Google Sheets + Apps Script stack that centralizes admissions, academics, finance, HR, marketing, and reporting for Matrix College. Most sheets include `appsscript.gs` and `Initial setup.gs` for validation, triggers, and workflows.



\*\*Core ideas:\*\* single source of truth, form-driven inputs, strict validation, automated PDFs/emails, scheduled jobs, and analysis-ready tables.
